Portfolio website project
This is a huge WIP
The Ajax functions have not been added in, nor have the pages but much of the CSS for it is written.
I wanted to do a dark/light theme, light is not implemented, function not available yet.
This continues to be a work in progress.
Future plans:
Polishing up current iteration
Implementing Ajax functionality
Reworking to use fetch (Ajax file templates are already set up, but I would like to move away from using it as it is resource intensive)
